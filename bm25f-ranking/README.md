## BM25F Ranking SOLR 4.0 plugin 


### Introduction
Ranking functions are one of the most important components of a document retrieval system.  A ranking function answers to the question "*what is the relevance of a document d for the user query q?*". Therefore,  the goodness of the ranking function adopted determines the quality of the results returned.The probably most widely used ranking function is [BM25][bm25], and it is still considered the most relevant baseline. Grounded in the probabilistic language modelling theory, BM25 was designed  as a non-linear combination of three important document attributes: term frequency, document frequency, and document length. Even if originally, Web documents where considered as composed of few fields, such as body, title, URL, BM25 uses a flat representation of a document, where its fields are simply concatenated  into a single textual description. But we know that Europeana documents have a very rich structure and they are described by means of many fields, each possibly playing a different role in the document retrieval task.
  
[BM25F][bm25f] is an extension of BM25 that exploits a document description having multiple fields, and it is still a non-linear function, thus capable of modelling non-trivial factors that determine relevance of a document for a given query. You can find a detailed explanation of bm25f in this [paper](http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec13/papers/microsoft-cambridge.web.hard.pdf).

### BM25F Solr Plugin

The [BM25F ranking function][bm25f] comes as a [Solr Query Parser plugin][solr]. In order to install it, the following steps have to be performed: 

1. Create a jar of the module ./bm25f-solr-ranking containing all the dependences.  Run the command mvn assembly:assembly within the ./bm25f-solr-ranking folder will produce the jar in the target folder, (i.e. ''bm25f-solr-ranking-xx-jar-with-dependencies.jar'')

2. Move the jar in the lib folder of the core containing the your index folder, or in the main lib of solr ( see also [the CoreAdmin documentation][solr1]), please note that by default Solr does not have the lib folder, youâ€™ll have to create it.
3. Override the default Solr Similarity function with the BM25F Similarity function, i.e., open the ''schema.xml'' file in your core and add: 

		<schema name="europeana" version="1.4">
			<!-- BM25FSimilarity overriding the default similarity -->
			<similarity class="eu.europeana.ranking.bm25f.similarity.BM25FSimilarityFactory" />
			...
		</schema>
    
4. Add the new query type and the new query handler, i.e., open the ''solrconfig.xml'' file in your core and add:
		
		<queryParser name="bm25f"
			class="eu.europeana.ranking.bm25f.BM25FParserPlugin">
				<str name="mainField">text</str>
					<float name="k1">2.052941</float>
					<lst name="fieldsBoost">
					<float name="text"> 0.6684119</float>
					<float name="title"> 1.9444914</float>
					<float name="what"> 0.015632015</float>
					<float name="when"> 1.8931717</float>
					<float name="who"> 0.7799127</float>
					</lst>
				<lst name="fieldsB">
					<float name="text"> 0.9766173</float>
					<float name="title"> 0.5606159</float>
					<float name="what"> 0.43865865</float>
					<float name="when"> 0.8196297</float>
					<float name="who"> 0.8619799</float>
				</lst>
		</queryParser>

The configuration file allows the admin to change the parameters. The customizable parameters are:
  * **K1**, the saturation factor;
  * **fieldsBoost**  containing the boosts to apply on the various fields;
  * **fieldsB**, containing the boosts to apply to the length of a field;
  * **mainField** the default field on which the query is performed.



Once the plugin has been plugged in, the BM25F ranking function can be called by simply adding the parameter defType=bm25f to the GET HTTP request, e.g. :
