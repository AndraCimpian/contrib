

To run the code locally:

1. Make sure you have latest play! installed and running

2. Create a new application in play: play new appname

3. Copy the directories app, lib, conf, public from svn to the directory of your new application

4. Go to your new application directory and run the application : playdir/appname>play run

5. You can use the URIs from conf/routes file to test the application for example: 
http://localhost:9000/awareness/digitalStories/list

6. Dummy html pages are included in the public directory and can be accessed like this:

http://localhost:9000/awareness/html/{filename}.html

so  http://localhost:9000/awareness/html/register.html will take you to dummy register


7. Europeana Search: First implementation (no filtering) using Europeana Search API v2.

http://localhost:9000/awareness/html/search.html 

8. For authorization purposes a play plugin is used. To activate it you must change your
Build.scala file in the project folder of your app to replace the value of 'appDependancies'
and 'main' so they look like this:

Solr dependencies must also be added:  

       val appDependencies = Seq(
           "be.objectify" %% "deadbolt-2" % "1.1.2",
           "org.apache.solr" % "solr-solrj" % "4.0.0"
        )

        val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
          resolvers += Resolver.url("Objectify Play Repository", url("http://schaloner.github.com/releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
          
        )
 
 
 9. application.conf under conf directory contains the field "application.baseUrl" which should be
 updated to the server url (current value->localhost:9000)
