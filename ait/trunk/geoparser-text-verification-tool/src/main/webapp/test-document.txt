Canada and the First Atomic Bombs
When C. D. Howe heard, on August 6, 1945, that a uranium bomb had destroyed the city of Hiroshima, he was not surprised. As Minister responsible for Canada's part in the World War II Atomic Bomb Project, he knew it was intended.
He had prepared a statement for the press in advance. "It is a distinct pleasure for me to announce," he said, "that Canadian scientists have played an intimate part, and have been associated in an effective way with this great scientific development."
Three days later, a plutonium bomb destroyed Nagasaki.
For the first time, Canadians were told that uranium from Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories, and scientists working in a secret laboratory in Montreal, had played an important role in the Anglo-Canadian-American Atomic Bomb Project -- the largest secret project in human history.
The tripartite A-Bomb Project was a joint venture that began in 1940-41. It was cemented with a secret Agreement signed by Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec City, August 1943.
The Quebec Agreement stipulated that the Bomb would not be used "against each other," or "against third parties without each other's consent". It also established a Combined Policy Committee of six to deal with the Bomb: three Americans, two Brits, and the Honourable C. D. Howe.
By the time the first A-Bombs were used, Roosevelt and Churchill were gone. Truman and Atlee, their successors, knew nothing about the atomic bomb before they came to office.
But Mackenzie King was still Prime Minister, and he knew. On October 11, 1945, he wrote in his diary: "How strange it is that I should find myself at the very centre of the problem, through Canada possessing uranium, having contributed to the production of the bomb, being recognized as one of the three countries to hold most of the secrets."
Stranger still is the secrecy that still shrouds Canada's historic role, and the lack of public awareness regarding Canada's current nuclear policies.
