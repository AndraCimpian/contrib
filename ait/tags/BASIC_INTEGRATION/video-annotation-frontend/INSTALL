This file describes a number of things necessary to be done before being able to run/develop this application.

* create build.properties based on build.properties.template
* modify FLEX_HOME in build.properties accordingly
* Internationalization support
	In order to have internationalization support for the application, you'll need to manually compile the appropriate locale bundles
	for your Flex SDK. In order to do so, run

	./copylocale en_US de_DE
	./copylocale en_US fr_FR
  
	from your Flex SDK 'bin' directory.
