Done:
* The package "nmaf" refers to Nuno's name.  package should be pt.utl.ist
* nmafCore.jar must be removed (relevant source code copied here)
* Many usages of Hashtable: should be Map/HashMap
* What is "WireIt"?  Looks like an entire project, but packed inside WEB-INF/jsp -> Javascript lib for visual mapping of metadata
* repox.tld should not be in source tree.. should be in WEB-INF? -> is now in WEB-INF/tld/repox.tld
* DataSource.importRecord(..) is used nowhere -> deleted
* DataSource.sendEmail() should use templating to compose email


REPOX Code Review
Gerald de Jong <geralddejong@gmail.com>

First Look, 2009-11-30:

* Properties files are currently in "resources" but contain Windows paths.  must be developer-configured, with only
  template committed to svn.

* The to do file is written in Portuguese

* Much use is made of "throws Exception" rather than more specific exceptions

* Much use is made of the DOM API, which is very cumbersome.  XStream recommended for config files.

* DOM is used in RecordSplitter etc: much memory usage, should use SAX/StAX

* Much work done for scheduling jobs => look at http://quartz.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/quartz/CronTrigger.html

* Much use made of java.util.Calendar => look at http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/

* Stripes web framework. From stripes homepage: "Others, like WebWork 2 and Spring-MVC are much better"

* DataProviderManagerTest, TaskFileHelperTest, TaskManagerTest, ScheduledTaskTest succeed, but
  produce ERROR stacktraces.  Can't be right.
  
* DatabaseAccess creates tables on the fly!  Is there not a better way to model the data?
