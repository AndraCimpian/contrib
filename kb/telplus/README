This directory contains TTP, a XHR Proxy with advanced features like
white listing. And RCM, a library to prevent misuse and DOS attacks
against the proxy.

For questions please contact Theo van Veen <theo.vanVeen@kb.nl>

Installation:
TTP requires RCM during compilation. Run "mvn install" first in the
directory "telplus/rcm/" and afterwards in "telplus/tpp"

You can also use "mvn jetty:run" in the directory "telplus/tpp" to
start the proxy directly from Maven.
