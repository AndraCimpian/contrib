Implementation guideline:

In /siwa/
---------
siwa.js: change the main config (the first two variables)
- siwaUrl: The absolute url to the .js files (normally http://[domain]/siwa/);
- ssUrl: The absolute url to the servicesserver (normally http://[domain]/servicesserver/);

cmenu.js: No changes required.
cmenu.css: No changes required.

proxy.js: depends on implementation. When using the proxy.php from the SIWA package, the
var proxyUrl should be changed to the absolute url of the proxy.php (normally 
http://[domain]/proxy/proxy.php). If another proxy implementation is used, this file should
be rewritten, keeping the function names intact.

In /proxy/
----------
When this proxy implementation is used, $currDomain should be changed to the right IP adress
of the new host. When the proxy gets a request to fetch an URL on the same domain by using 
the foreign ip address of the domain, the proxy will not be able to find it. $currDomain is
used to replace the foreign IP address by localhost.

In /servicesserver/
-------------------
No changes required.
